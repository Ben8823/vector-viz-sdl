To compile the program, use the following command:

nvcc -O2 -o vector_viz `sdl2-config --libs` vector_viz_main.cpp fontMono_24.cpp mp_renderer.cu `sdl2-config --cflags`

- To move around, use the mouse, mouse buttons and cursor keys. Use the cursor keys to center the screen on the point of interest, and then zoom in with left mouse button. Rotate the camera around the point of interest to make the 3D effect more easily perceptible.

- The numpad keys 5,8,4,6 can be used to move camera more steadily. Use the Numpad 4/6 keys to rotate around the point of interest, and Numpad 5/8 to zoom in/out slowly.

- Numpad 0 will move the point of interest back to the center of the grid.

- PrintScreen key will capture the screenshot in a .bmp file.

- PgUp / PgDn to change brighthess
- Home/End to change line length

- 'm' to toggle auto adjust (auto adjust will adjust line length and brightness based on camera distance)

- keys 'o' and 'p' change dot density (the changes are logarithmic). Dot density functions approximately as a quality parameter. However, a low dot density can also provide an interesting look on the input data (even more when line length is increased). Lower dot density requires much lower GPU processing power. Higher dot densities may cause FPS to fall. Also, at some point, there will not be enough GPU memory for additional dots.

- space key will pause the visualization

- ESC key to exit
